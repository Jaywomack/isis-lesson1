Tasks

First and foremost try to learn what is going on with the HTML and google anything you do not understand.

Pay attention to the classes and id's and try to style the page with a combination of using the elements classes and ids to target the html elements that you will be styling.

You will be using flexbox to move elements where you need them to go. It is a pain in the ass. Do not get discouraged, it eventually becomes pretty easy. CSS-tricks is the best place for flexbox explanations that i have found. Use Google.com a lot!

There is not pass fail here. Just learn as much as you can. Feel free to add more classes or ids wherever they are needed.

Bonus make the links at the top scroll down to the sections on the page that they are related to. Its actually pretty easy. the a link will point to where ever you tell it to. The navigation is already put on the a links to point towards the sections. You need to put the ids on the sections and it shoul work.
